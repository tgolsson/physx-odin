# ðŸŽ³ physx-odin

**Unsafe automatically-generated Odin bindings for [NVIDIA PhysX 5.1](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX) C++ API.**

</div>

This is a fork from [`physx-rs`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/physx-rs), using the same methodology for binding
generation. Check out the [`physx-sys`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/physx-rs/tree/main/physx-sys) and related
presentation for more information.

## Getting started


As of right now, no libraries are shipped as they'd be > 200 MB in
total. Soon~ I hope to have prebuilt binaries + generated files as
Github releases. However, building everything locally *should* be
easy: the provided `justfile` contains a build command. This should
run all codegen, followed by building the native libraries and copying
them to the repository root.

## Basic usage


```c
main :: proc() {
	using physx

	foundation := create_foundation_ext()
	dispatcher := default_cpu_dispatcher_create(
		1,
		nil,
		physx.DefaultCpuDispatcherWaitForWorkMode.WaitForWork,
		0,
	)

	physics := create_physics_ext(foundation)


scene_desc := scene_desc_new(tolerances_scale_new(1.0, 10.0))
	scene_desc.gravity = vec3_new_3(0.0, -9.81, 0.0)
	scene_desc.cpuDispatcher = dispatcher
	scene_desc.filterShader = get_default_simulation_filter_shader()
	scene := physics_create_scene_mut(physics, scene_desc)
	defer {
		scene_release_mut(scene)
		physics_release_mut(physics)
		default_cpu_dispatcher_release_mut(dispatcher)
		foundation_release_mut(foundation)
	}

	run(physics, scene)
}
```

## Examples

### [Ball](examples/ball.rs)

A simple example to showcase how to use physx-sys. It can be run with `odin run examples/ball.odin -file`.
